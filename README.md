# Advanced Engineering Mathematics

## Introduction
![Example figure](figures/output.png)

While preparing for qualifying exams, I've produced a pile of notes sourced from the Advanced Engineering Mathematics book by E. Kreyszig.
For reusability, I tried to compactly summarize key topics on a single page, including Linear Algebra, ODEs, PDEs, Laplace Transforms, and Vector Analysis.
Although math is best learned through proofs, these notes may be useful for readers who already have familiarity with the concepts or who are looking for a relevant roadmap.

To make it more accessible, I converted handwritten notes to LaTeX using Claude.

If you want to contribute, feel free to update the tex files and open a pull request; otherwise, enjoy!
